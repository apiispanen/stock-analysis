## Overview of Project
Steve is a 

### Background
The dataset here is for green stocks, which are environmentally friendly stocks. Per our module, we have picked 12 stocks to analyze specifically, in aid of Steve's project. 

## Challenges
Using VBA to analyze stock information has many benefits. With its benefits, however, there are significant setbacks.

### Using VBA
Visual Basic for Applications is a useful tool for analyzing spreadsheet data in bulk. 
### Refactoring Code

Refactoring code that was taken from the module in VBA can be quite difficult. For one, refactoring existing code and changing data structures require significant debugging and error handling. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to doing so:

#### Advantages
Refactoring code is extremely useful for optimizing existing codes. For one, we simplified the data structures by creating arrays for the volumes and starting and ending prices. It can also give a developer a head start on a problem, utilizing existing code and changing it internally to optimize the amount of processing it requires, the simplicity of the code, or to make it less buggy. 

#### Disadvantages 
Refactoring existing code can also make waste. For one, it can cause unecessary extra steps to be made, as usually refactored code is not made in tandem with its original. Instead, it is typically made by another developer, or by the same person after a substantial period of time has passed. This results in a lack of full understanding of the code, whereas starting from scratch may help to enhance their understanding of the code they are working with.
